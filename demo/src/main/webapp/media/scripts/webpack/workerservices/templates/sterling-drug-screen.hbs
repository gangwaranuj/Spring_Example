		<h1>Many Organizations Require Drug Testing</h1>
		<p>Many organizations require drug testing to ensure a safer and more productive work environment. Work Market handles your private information with the highest security standards. Data entered here that was not already part of your profile is provided securely to Sterling and is not saved with your profile going forward.</p>
		<p>Work Market has partnered with Sterling to provide background screening tools for the people on our network.</p>
		<p>With your permission, Work Market will initiate the drug screening process that requires you to physically visit a drug testing facility and provide a specimen for testing. Sterling will provide details on testing locations near you, required procedure and paperwork to successfully complete the drug test.</p>
		<p>If the results of your drug test are "CLEAR", meaning there are no infractions of any kind in your report, you will receive a status and icon on your Work Market profile indicating that you passed the drug test.</p>
		<p>If the results of your drug test include any infractions, you will have the opportunity to view your report and contest the results with Sterling.</p>
