Regardless of the model a fee is earned and it comes from you the client. Your money ends up in the pocket of the website operators.  Consistent with our philosophy of running a clear, transparent and honest business we allow you to set pricing up how you perceive it should be. You can "charge" the fee to the seller (choice 1), absorb the fee for the seller (choice 2) or use an advanced version of the calculator that lets you select how you want this handled for each assignment. The default Work Market setting is choice 1. Of course subscription clients dont have to deal with this topic as they have one price paid on a monthly basis.
