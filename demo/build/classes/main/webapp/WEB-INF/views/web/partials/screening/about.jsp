		<h3>What Happens Next</h3>

		<div class="well-content">
			<p>
				If the results of your background check are "CLEAR", meaning there are no infractions of any
				kind in your report, you will receive a status and <img class="screening-icon" src="${mediaPrefix}/images/live_icons/assignments/passed_check_2.svg">
				icon on your Work Market profile indicating
				that you passed this background check.
			</p>

			<p>
				You will therefore rank higher on our people searches, be eligible to join more client talent pools
				and get more work from clients on Work Market.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the results of your background check include any infractions, you will have the opportunity
				to view your report and contest the results with Sterling.
